# Dow Jones Project from Reddit sentiment

I found that the aggregate sentiment of the top 25 Reddit articles has no influence on the outcomes and volatility of the Dow Jones, for that particular day.  
This finding is based on multiple regression analysis of the Dow Jones returns and volatility, as compared to the sentiment measured through the Vader Sentiment tool, of the top 25 articles on Reddit each day.
