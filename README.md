# Dow Jones Project from Reddit sentiment

I wanted to find out if there was any predictive quality between the sentiment of the top 25 Reddit articles for the day, and the returns of the Dow Jones Industrial average or volatility. 

We used the Vector tool to determine the sentiment, which quanitified it into three buckets: Positive, Neutral, Negative.  Utilizing those values, i created a multiple regression analysis against the sentiment numbers and DJIA returns and volatility, for each day of the last ten years. 

I found that the aggregate sentiment of the top 25 Reddit articles has no influence on the returns or volatility of the Dow Jones, for that particular day.  

Our machine learning models also had the same conclusion.
